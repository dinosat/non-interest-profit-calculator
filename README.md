# Loan Calculator

The Loan Calculator is a Java program that calculates the total profit and return on investment (ROI) for a loan repayment scenario.

## Features

- Accepts user input for total capital, loan capital, payback years, and rent.
- Calculates the total profit over the loan payback period.
- Calculates the ROI based on the initial investment and total profit.
- Displays the total profit and ROI.

## Getting Started

To use the Loan Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.

## Usage

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter the following values:

- `totalCapital`: The total capital available.
- `loanCapital`: The initial loan capital.
- `payBackYears`: The number of years to pay back the loan.
- `rent`: The monthly rent.

The program will then calculate the total profit by simulating yearly loan repayments and rental income. It will display the profit for each year and the cumulative total profit. Additionally, it will calculate the ROI based on the initial investment and display the value.

## Output Formatting

The ROI and total profit values are formatted to display only two decimal places after the comma.
